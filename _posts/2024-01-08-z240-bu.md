## Listing unRAID Plugins

Primary Server - Ashla 
- ![ASHLA Installed Plugins](/assets/posts/2024-01/2024-01-08_1.png)

TL;DR
Unaware of another method for listing installed plugins. 
```bash
ls -l /usr/local/emhttp/plugins/
```


### HOWTO
1. **SSH into your Unraid server:**
   Use an SSH client (like PuTTY on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux) to connect to your Unraid server. You will need the IP address or hostname of your server and the login credentials. Or access your server locally via `Terminal`

   ```bash
   ssh your_username@your_unraid_server_ip
   ```

2. **Navigate to the plugins folder:**
   The plugins are usually stored in the `/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/` directory. You can use the `cd` command to navigate to this folder.

   ```bash
   cd /usr/local/emhttp/plugins/
   ```

3. **List installed plugins:**
   Use the `ls` command to list the contents of the current directory. This will show you the installed plugins.

   ```bash
   ls
   ```

   The output will display the names of the folders, each corresponding to a plugin.

Keep in mind that the exact path and method might vary slightly depending on your Unraid version. Also, new features or changes might have been introduced after my last update in January 2022.

Always be cautious when accessing system files and directories, as modifying or deleting critical files can lead to system issues. If you're unsure, it's a good idea to check the Unraid forums or documentation for the most up-to-date information.
