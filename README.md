# Docs README

`v0.1`

The goal of this space is to create an archive for my Homelab notes and projects. 

It is my hope that a `Polak` from the future can benefit from my experiences. [gregoryrudinsky.github.io](https://gregoryrudinsky.github.io)




This project was inspired by [Techno Tim](https://youtu.be/F8iOU1ci19Q). Please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).
