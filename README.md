# Docs README

`v0.1`

I started a homelab somehwere in 2022 and quickly realized the value documenting things. The goal of this space is to create an archive for my Homelab notes and projects.

This project was inspired by [Techno Tim](https://youtu.be/F8iOU1ci19Q). Please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).
