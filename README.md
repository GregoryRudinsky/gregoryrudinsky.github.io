# Docs README

`v0.1`

The goal of this space is to create an archive for my Homelab notes and projects. It is my hope that a `Polak` from the future can benefit from my experiences. This is also my first attempt at maintaining a website. I cloned the theme from a glorious dev. 

Please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).

```text
Roundabout February 2022 I installed OpenWRT on a forgettable Netgear GS105Ev2 router. That was the catalyst into a fantastic obsession with technology. Eventually I learned the hip kids on Reddit referred to this as a Homelab. And since I've realized that I have accomplished quite a bit, learned a little and have broken even more. 

I wish I had documented my initial endevours from the early days. I could use a chuckle.
